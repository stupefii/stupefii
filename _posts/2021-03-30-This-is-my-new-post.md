If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.

I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.

Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.

Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.

Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.

　　3月30日上午11点多，在中国一重水压机锻造厂车间里，世界领先的1.5万吨自由锻造水压机正锤炼着一根通红的“铁柱”。

　　站在距离“铁柱”十几米远处，热浪和轰鸣依旧迎面扑来。“经过四个半小时的捶打锻造，电机转子成品便可以脱颖而出了。”这台水压机的操作者、2019年“大国工匠”年度人物刘伯鸣说。

　　寒来暑往，从事锻造工30年以来，刘伯鸣与这台1.5万吨自由锻造水压机“钟情陪伴”，独创40种锻造方法，开发31项锻造技术，攻克90余项重大产品锻造工艺难关，填补国内行业空白40项

器物庞大，手下却是“绣花”的活；力有千钧，心中却系“毫厘”之事。刘伯鸣所在的锻造工序在装备制造行业中的地位十分重要，特别是大型锻件制造技术，是衡量一个国家工业实力的重要标志。

　　刘伯鸣深知锻造在整个工艺流程中的重要性，也深知“卡脖子”之痛。“凭借多年经验比对各部尺寸，我们破解了超大钢锭中心压实、超大截锻件面晶粒细化、机械性能均匀性等技术瓶颈。”刘伯鸣说。

　　一次次测量辅具和封头，精细调整水压机控制变形，在百吨锻件上做足“绣花”功夫。凭借严谨精细的工匠精神、丰富扎实的经验积累和锻造技术，他指挥锻造的核电锻件产品全部一次合格，每一件都是精品，提高了我国核电产品20年使用寿命。
I hope you like it!
